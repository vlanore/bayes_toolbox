functions to perform Bayesian inference with MCMC algorithms.

This software is governed by the CeCILL-C license under French law and abiding by the rules of

modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user in light of its specific status
of free software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means
that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge.
Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the software's suitability as regards their
requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions as regards security.
