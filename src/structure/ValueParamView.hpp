/* A value view is a functor that takes a function and applies it to a set of values.
For example, a value view of a node array would be a function that given a function f calls f on all
the values of the elements of the array.
It's a simple wrapper around a lambda. It statically checks that the lambda can accept a function as
parameter. */
